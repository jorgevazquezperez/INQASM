In these examples we perform the full pipeline of compilation and execute the result in the NetSQUID simulator in order to show that the compilation was perform correctly.

In the examples exposed inside the CUQUI package we are just performing the compilation from InQuIR to NetQASM, with no execution whatsoever of the code. Neither in any simulator, nor in any actual quantum computer.

**\#TODO** Explain how to execute this examples.
