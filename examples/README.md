# Examples
The examples here displayed are divided in two categories: the **CUQUI examples** and the **NetQASM examples**. 

The CUQUI examples, located in the `cuqui` folder, are just a series of InQuIR files with their associated NetQASM files prodect of the compilation. These files are displayed here in order for the user to compare and check that CUQUI is properly working.

On the other hand, the NetQASM examples, located in the `NetQASM` folder are composed by two folders: one starting with the *cuqui* name and the other starting with the *netqasm* name. They are responsible for executing the NetQASM subroutines with the NetQASM framework. The firs one employs the subruoutines generated by the CUQUI compiler and the second one the subroutines generated by the NetQASM framework. This is done to check that the CUQUI compilation gives the same resultas as the NetQASM framework, checking then the correctness of the compiler. In these examples  the simulations are performed in the NetSQUID simulator.

**\#TODO** Explain how to execute this examples.
